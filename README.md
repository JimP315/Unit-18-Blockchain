1. Add a Streamlit slider component that allows the user to select a difficulty 
# value from 1 to 5. Set the starting value to 3. Set this component equal to a 
# variable named `difficulty`.
# 2.Update the `difficulty` data attribute of the `PyChain` data class 
# (`pychain.difficulty`) with this new `difficulty` value.

# Add a Streamlit slider named "Block Difficulty" that allows the user to update a 
# difficulty value. Set this equal to the variable `difficulty`
# Kept getting an error that streamlit could not be resolved. 
# the pychain ledger initially would not update, and I had some issues with not being able to get the new block inputs correct with the record(sender, receiver, amount) details.
